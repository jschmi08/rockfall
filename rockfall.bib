	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808},
	abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations of rockfall trajectories are a standard procedure for evaluating rockfall hazards. For these simulations, corresponding software codes must be calibrated and evaluated based on field data. This study addresses methods of repeatable rockfall tests, and investigates whether it is possible to produce traceable and statistically analysable data. A testing series is described extensively covering how to conduct rockfall experiments and how certain elements of rockfall trajectories can be measured. The tests use acceleration and rotation sensors inside test blocks, a system to determine block positions over time, surveying measurements, and video recordings. All systems are evaluated regarding their usability in the field and for analyses. The highly detailed description of testing methods is the basis for sound understanding and reproducibility of the tests. This article serves as a reference for future publications and other rockfall field tests, both as a guide and as a basis for comparisons. First analyses deliver information on runout with a shadow angle ranging between 21 and 45 degrees for a slope consisting of homogeneous soft soil. A digital elevation model of the test site as well as point clouds of the used test blocks are part of this publication.},

	volume = {5},
	doi = {10.1051/ijmqe/2014007},
	abstract = {This article proposes a combined theoretical and experimental approach to assess and
quantify the global uncertainty of a high-speed camera velocity measurement. The study is
divided in five sections: firstly, different sources of measurement uncertainties
performed by a high-speed camera are identified and quantified. They consist of
geometrical uncertainties, pixel discretisation uncertainties or optical uncertainties.
Secondly, a global uncertainty factor, taking into account the previously identified
sources of uncertainties, is computed. Thirdly, a sensibility study of the camera set-up
parameters is performed, allowing the experimenter to optimize these parameters in order
to minimize the final uncertainties. Fourthly, the theoretical computed uncertainty is
compared with experimental measurements. Good concordance has been found. Finally, the
velocity measurement uncertainty study is extended to continuous displacement measurements
as a function of time. The purpose of this article is to propose all the mathematical
tools necessary to quantify the individual and global uncertainties, to highlight the
important aspects of the experimental set-up, and to give recommendations on how to
improve a specific set-up in order to minimize the global uncertainty. Taking all these
into account, it has been shown that highly dynamic phenomena such as a ballistic
phenomenon can be measured using a high-speed camera with a global uncertainty of less
than 2\%.},

	abstract = {There are various protection measures against rockfalls. An embankment is effective in rockfall hazard mitigation at a dangerous slope end. The slope rockfall tests on full-scale embankments have been carried out. These embankments are made of sandy soil reinforced with geogrids. The cushioning layers which are made of geocells filled with crushed stones of 5-13 mm in diameter are also placed on the mountain side of the embankment. A boulder, i.e., {RC} block rolls down the test-site slope, and hits against the embankment. A new system of measuring instruments is employed in order to evaluate the impact force and the impact energy. One of important observations is a possibility that a rolling boulder carries it toward the top of an embankment because of its rolling momentum. The experimental results, especially the relationship between impact force and impact energy is discussed in this paper.},
